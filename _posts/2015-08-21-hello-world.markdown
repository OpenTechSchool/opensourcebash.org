> Lift off, we have a lift off!

After countless hours of thought and planning, work, sweat and tears, the website just went live. It is still a rough cut and many things are still missing, but at least the DNS resolves correctly ðŸ˜ƒ. This is also the perfect chance to introduce you to our mascot:


#### __Bashy__ â€“ the GNUnicorn

[![Bashy The GNUnicorn](/img/sprites/logo.png)](/img/sprites/logo-big.svg)

As you might know, Unicorns are the love children of ponies and [narwhals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narwhal) â€“ with the very visible central, spiral horn on the forehead as a well known charactaristic. Unlike popular believe, when such a unicorn has an affair with a gnu â€“ the resulting GNUnicorn doesn't have one or three horns but the usual two gnu horns. A GNUnicorns horns, however, are spiral and colorful like the rainbow.

_Bashy_, despite the name, isn't a very aggressive animal, but rather prefers open _discourse, collaboration and communication_. Traits, very common among GNUnicorns in general.



Stay tuned to learn more about it, soon.
