We are very happy to announce the first two teams to join and present at the OpenSourceBash in Berlin: **Rust and Hoodie**.

##### Rust

First up is [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/):

> Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents nearly all segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

Among others it features `zero-cost abstractions`, `guaranteed memory safety`,
`pattern matching`, and `threads without data races`. Most people will probably know it as the language with the interesting `memory borrowing concept` [developed initially in the Mozilla Research Labs](https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2012-January/001256.html) a few years back.

We are very excited to have **[Florian](/#presenting)** from the local [Rust Chapter and Community Team Member](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) join us to present rust.

##### Hoodie

Secondly the great people from [hood.ie](http://hood.ie/) will be with us:

> Hoodie enables you to express yourself through technology by making web app development very fast, easy and accessible.
>
> Itâ€™s a complete backend for your apps: develop your frontend code, plug it into our API and your app is ready.

Hoodie offers a `no-backend`, `offline first` approach to web-development. Aside from that hoodie is known for the strong [diversity and emporement values](http://hood.ie/about/) their community is driven by. We are very happy to have **[Alex](/#presenting)**, Frontend Developer, Designer and offline-first advocate, with us this time.
