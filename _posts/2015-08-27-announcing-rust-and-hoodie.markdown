We are very happy to announce the first three teams to join and present at the OpenSourceBash in Berlin – **Rust, Hoodie and Diaspora\*** – as well as announce that Women Who Code Berlin decided to join the party!

##### Rust

First up is [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/):

> Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents nearly all segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

Among others it features `zero-cost abstractions`, `guaranteed memory safety`,
`pattern matching`, and `threads without data races`. Most people will probably know it as the language with the interesting `memory borrowing concept`, [developed initially in the Mozilla Research Labs](https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2012-January/001256.html) a few years back.

We are very excited to have **[Florian](/#presenting)** from the local [Rust Chapter and Community Team Member](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) join us to present rust.

##### Hoodie

Secondly, the great people from [hood.ie](http://hood.ie/) will be with us:

> Hoodie enables you to express yourself through technology by making web app development very fast, easy and accessible.
>
> It’s a complete backend for your apps: develop your frontend code, plug it into our API and your app is ready.

Hoodie offers a `no-backend`, `offline first` approach to web-development. Aside from that hoodie is known as a diverse community driven by strong [core values](http://hood.ie/about/). We are very happy to have **[Alex](/#presenting)**, Frontend Developer, Designer and offline-first advocate, present this project.

##### Diaspora\*

The third to present are the **[Lisa and Julia](/#presenting)** from [diaspora\*](https://www.diasporafoundation.org/):

> diaspora* is a free personal web server that implements a distributed social networking service. Installations of the software form nodes (termed "pods") which make up the distributed Diaspora social network.

You might remember it for the [amazing kickstarter campaign back in 2010](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mbs348/diaspora-the-personally-controlled-do-it-all-distr) or simply for their bold statements about replacing facebook.

### Women Who Code Berlin

Lastly we are happy to announce that we have the Berlin Chapter of "Women Who Code" on board to help us spread the word about the event.

> Women Who Code (WWCode) is a global 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to inspiring women to excel in technology careers. We connect amazing women with other like minded amazing women around the globe who unite under one simple notion – the world of technology is much better with women in it.

We strongly believe the OpenSource community would benefit from a more diverse contributor base and hope to see many women at our event.

Thank you all so much for participating!
