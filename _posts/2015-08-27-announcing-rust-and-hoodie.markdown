We are very happy to announce the first three teams to join and present at the OpenSourceBash in Berlin – **Rust, Hoodie and Diaspora\*** – as well as announce that Women Who Code Berlin decided to join the party!

##### Rust

First up is [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/):

> Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents nearly all segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

Among others it features `zero-cost abstractions`, `guaranteed memory safety`,
`pattern matching`, and `threads without data races`. Most people will probably know it as the language with the interesting `memory borrowing concept` [developed initially in the Mozilla Research Labs](https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2012-January/001256.html) a few years back.

We are very excited to have **[Florian](/#presenting)** from the local [Rust Chapter and Community Team Member](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) join us to present rust.

##### Hoodie

Secondly the great people from [hood.ie](http://hood.ie/) will be with us:

> Hoodie enables you to express yourself through technology by making web app development very fast, easy and accessible.
>
> It’s a complete backend for your apps: develop your frontend code, plug it into our API and your app is ready.

Hoodie offers a `no-backend`, `offline first` approach to web-development. Aside from that hoodie is known for the strong [diversity and emporement values](http://hood.ie/about/) their community is driven by. We are very happy to have **[Alex](/#presenting)**, Frontend Developer, Designer and offline-first advocate, with us this time.

##### Diaspora\*

The third to present are the **[Lisa and Julia](/#presenting)** from [diaspora\*](https://www.diasporafoundation.org/):

> diaspora* is a free personal web server that implements a distributed social networking service. Installations of the software form nodes (termed "pods") which make up the distributed Diaspora social network.

You might remember it for the [amazing kickstarter campaign they did in 2010](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mbs348/diaspora-the-personally-controlled-do-it-all-distr) or simply for their bold statements about replacing facebook.

### Women Who Code Berlin

Lastly we are happy to announce to have the Berlin Chapter of "Women Who Code" on board and helping us spread the word about the event.

> Women Who Code (WWCode) is a global 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to inspiring women to excel in technology careers. We connect amazing women with other like minded amazing women around the globe who unite under one simple notion – the world of technology is much better with women in it.


Thank you all so much!
