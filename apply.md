__You are part of an awesome OpenSource project? You are looking for more people to join, help and contribute? Present it at this OpenSourceBash.__ This page gives you an overview what is expected and how you can do that.

#### Requirements

The aim of the event is to connect potential contributor with current team members of interesting open source projects. Here are some requirements about your projects and the person presenting it:

 - The project must be under available public **under an [OSI approved licence](http://opensource.org/licenses/)** (dual licencing is accepted)
 - The project's **main (business) logic must be available under such a licence**: projects which rely on a non-opensource-licenced third-party to do the heavy lifting won't be accepted (e.g. default dropbox client)
 - The project **must have a team** of people working on it – solitary pet project don't count
 - The **person presenting must be part of that team** (no pitching of other peoples projects or third party stuff you aren't actively involved in)
 - complete the application form below

The following aren't required, but highly encouraged. And in case of a tie, the project, which scores highest on this list will have preferred seating:

 - Have contributors guidelines and processes
 - Have bugs/tickets specifically to get people started
 - Have a contributors setup guide
 - Runs under a Code of Conduct
 - Have an automatic test suite run against Patches/Pull-Requests


#### Presentation Details

A presentation is allowed to take **5 minutes**. Our recommendation is to take the first three covering the project itself, what the goal and vision are, the technologies it is based on, and use the remaining two minutes to explain what you are looking for and how people can contribute. We recommend to briefly cover what the entire contribution process looks like.

You may use slides, show websites, screenshots or whatever you want to present. **All presentation will be shown from the same laptop** – to reduce the plug-on-plug-off-hassle – consider it a fabric new mac book air (with firefox and chrome on it). Make sure to have send in whatever you want to present prior to the event. We recommend to use an online service like [slides.com](http://www.slides.com) to prepare and show your slides.

You can check whether your presentation is the way you want to right before the batch you are in.

####  Application Process

We have fifteen presentations slots available. Ten slots will be filled prior, the other five can only be claimed during the event. Please use the following form to let us know about your interest in presenting. We will assign the first five slots among all presentations filed _before September 5th_, the second five will be picked from all presentations send in _before September 12th_. Projects will be announced on the website and you'll receive an email in either case.

_In both cases projects which have more of the prior mentioned encouraged criteria will be preferred_.

The third batch of five slots can only be claimed at the event itself. There will be a way to register your presentation at the beginning of the event. Prior mentioned criteria still apply. Slots are assigned first come, first serve.
